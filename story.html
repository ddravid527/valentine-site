Hyy Ishu ❤️,<br><br>

This is the first Valentine’s Day that came after I got you… and this is the first time I’m truly realizing that this day is meant for lovers. Thank you for making me realize this 💌<br><br>

From the day I fell in love with you, I started living with you in my heart. I was an angry, rude guy… but living with you made me a funny, soft person 😊<br><br>

I still remember those days when you felt so shy and lowered your head whenever you saw me 🫣 Your nervous body, your confusion, your fear… all of it is still living inside my heart forever.<br><br>

I remember the times you waited for my texts… the attention you silently wished for… those moments are unforgettable 💬  
I texted you from the gym, while traveling, and through countless midnight conversations 🌙 Those chats became the happiest part of my life.<br><br>

And our first kiss on 14th March 2025… it was full of fear, love, and magic 💋✨ I will never forget that moment.<br><br>

The first night I spent with you… that was the night I truly started living with you completely 🤍<br><br>

On November 11th, around 8 AM, when you wore the dress I bought for you and walked towards me… I don’t know when I fell in love with you, but on that day, I fell deeper than ever before 👗❤️<br><br>

The guy who had 0% belief in God… that 70kg, 6-feet rude guy… entered a temple just because you walked in front of him 🙏 Even now, it feels unbelievable to me.<br><br>

I’m learning, improving, and pushing myself every day to prove myself worthy in your home. I wake up early, I work harder, and I prepare myself for our future 💪 Even creating this surprise for you shows one truth — nothing in this world is more important to me than you.<br><br>

Enough words…<br><br>

I love you, pondati ❤️<br><br>

We are going to marry soon 💍 Everything will go exactly like our plan.<br><br>

And even if something doesn’t… DD will handle everything with his left hand 💪 Because my right hand will always be holding you forever 🤝❤️<br><br>

And there are promises waiting for you… from your DUDU 💌<br><br>

— Your DUDU
